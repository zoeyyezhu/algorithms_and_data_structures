    "My Question: Check Duplicates in Tree\n",
    "When tasked with designing a function to check for duplicates in a binary tree, my approach involved a combination of depth-first search (DFS) and a set to track visited values. I aimed to ensure the solution efficiently identified duplicates by traversing the tree only once. The challenge was managing edge cases, such as when the tree is empty or contains only unique values. Through iterative testing and adjustments, I refined the function to handle various scenarios effectively.\n",

    "My partner's question involved identifying missing numbers in a given list within a specific range. Their approach leveraged set operations to compute the missing numbers efficiently. Reviewing their solution, I appreciated the use of sets for efficient difference calculations. However, I noticed minor improvements could be made, such as handling edge cases (e.g., empty lists) and ensuring the function signature was precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presentation and Review Experience\n",
    "During our review sessions, I presented my approach to checking duplicates in a binary tree. Explaining my thought process and the rationale behind each step helped me solidify my understanding of the problem. My partner provided insightful feedback, particularly on optimizing space complexity by considering iterative solutions instead of recursive ones for deep trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "When reviewing my partner's solution, I emphasized clarity and edge case handling. I suggested refining the function signature and incorporating detailed comments to enhance readability and maintainability. This collaborative process not only improved our respective solutions but also deepened our understanding of different problem-solving strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the experience was enriching. It highlighted the importance of clear communication, thorough testing, and considering edge cases in algorithm design. Collaborating with my partner fostered a constructive exchange of ideas, ultimately leading to more robust solutions for both our problems.\n"
